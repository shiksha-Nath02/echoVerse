Problem Summary: Prisma Configuration Conflict
The Problem:
I encountered a "Missing required environment variable: DATABASE_URL" error when running npx prisma generate, even though the .env file with the correct DATABASE_URL was properly configured in the project root.

The Root Cause:
The issue was caused by a configuration file naming conflict. I had a file named prisma.config.ts in the project root, which Prisma automatically tried to load as a custom configuration module. This file was being loaded before the environment variables from the .env file were initialized, causing Prisma to fail when it tried to access process.env.DATABASE_URL prematurely.

The Solution:
I identified that the prisma.config.ts file was interfering with Prisma's standard initialization workflow. By removing this conflicting configuration file, Prisma reverted to its default behavior of:

First loading environment variables from .env

Then processing the prisma/schema.prisma file

Successfully generating the Prisma Client

Key Takeaway:
This taught me about Prisma's configuration loading order and the importance of understanding how tools initialize their environment. Sometimes, what seems like an environment variable issue can actually be a configuration timing or naming conflict problem.

This demonstrates debugging skills in identifying non-obvious root causes and understanding tooling behavior beyond surface-level errors.
