a query language for your API- GraphQL
-> happens at runtime
-> existing data
-> allows client to ask for exactly what data is req.

KEY COMPONETS
-> query based-> query to server -> responds with exact data-> no fixed response
-> single end point-> /graphql-> data we want will be defined in the req
-> schema based-> strongy typed
-> resolver-> funtion that tells graphQL how to fetch that data for a perticular field //filter
-> mutations-> write, update, delete

REST VS GRAPHql
no multi end points
overfetching-> avoided
underfetching-> avoided
api-> versions-> no versioning because of scehma
